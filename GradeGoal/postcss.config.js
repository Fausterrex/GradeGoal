/**
 * PostCSS Configuration for GradeGoal Application
 * 
 * This file configures PostCSS, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins.
 * PostCSS processes CSS after it's written and before it's delivered to the browser.
 * 
 * Current Configuration:
 * - Empty configuration file (no PostCSS plugins currently needed)
 * - Tailwind CSS handles most CSS processing through Vite integration
 * - Can be extended with additional PostCSS plugins as needed
 * 
 * Common Use Cases:
 * - CSS autoprefixing for browser compatibility
 * - CSS minification and optimization
 * - CSS custom properties and variables
 * - Advanced CSS transformations
 * 
 * Note: This file is currently empty as Tailwind CSS and Vite handle
 * most CSS processing requirements. It can be extended in the future
 * if additional PostCSS functionality is needed.
