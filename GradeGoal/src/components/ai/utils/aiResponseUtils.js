TARGET GOAL:

- Priority Level: ${priorityLevel}
- Note: ${goalType === 'COURSE_GRADE' ? 'Target is a percentage grade (0-100%)' : 'Target is in GPA format (0.0-4.0 scale)'}

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. **PREDICTED FINAL GRADE**: Calculate the likely final grade based on current scores + remaining assessments
2. **ASSESSMENT GRADE RECOMMENDATIONS**: Specific score recommendations for each upcoming assessment
3. **TARGET GOAL ANALYSIS**: Provide analysis of the target goal achievability:
   - Calculate the current weighted grade %.
   - Simulate perfect scores on all remaining assessments ‚Üí compute maximum possible final grade % and GPA.
   - Compare maximum possible vs target and provide analysis.
   - Show clearly the minimum score required on each pending assessment to still reach the target.
   - Use GPA-to-percentage mapping rules when target is GPA (e.g., "‚â•97% = 4.0").
4. **STATUS UPDATE**: Current academic status and progress summary
5. **FOCUS INDICATORS**: Identify which assessment categories need attention (e.g Assignments, Quizzes, Exams, Empty Categories)
6. **SCORE PREDICTIONS**: Predict what scores are needed on upcoming assessments to reach the target
7. **EMPTY CATEGORIES ANALYSIS**: CRITICAL - If there are empty categories:
   - Explain that the course is NOT truly complete until all categories have assessments
   - Provide specific recommendations for each empty category
   - Calculate the impact of adding assessments to empty categories
   - Suggest appropriate assessment types and quantities
   - Provide target scores needed for new assessments to maintain/achieve goals
   - Include empty categories in focusIndicators with HIGH priority
   - Add specific recommendations for each empty category in topPriorityRecommendations

CRITICAL DISTINCTION:
- **COMPLETED ASSESSMENTS**: Already graded - provide analysis of performance and areas for improvement
- **UPCOMING/PENDING ASSESSMENTS**: Not yet taken - provide PREPARATION strategies, study tips, and target scores
- **EMPTY CATEGORIES**: Categories with 0 assessments - HIGH PRIORITY for adding assessments
- DO NOT treat assessments marked as "UPCOMING - NOT YET TAKEN" as poor performance
- DO NOT assign HIGH priority to categories where all assessments are already completed
- For upcoming assessments, focus on preparation recommendations, not remediation

PRIORITY ASSIGNMENT RULES FOR COMPLETED ASSESSMENTS:
- **LOW PRIORITY**: Average score 80% or higher (e.g., 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 100%)
- **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Average score 70-79% (e.g., 70%, 75%, 78%)
- **HIGH PRIORITY**: Average score below 70% (e.g., 60%, 65%, 68%)

EXAMPLES:
- Exam with 80% average = LOW PRIORITY (good performance)
- Quiz with 75% average = MEDIUM PRIORITY (room for improvement)
- Assignment with 65% average = HIGH PRIORITY (needs improvement)

7. **TOP PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS**: Provide exactly 5 most important recommendations with:
   - Mix of course-specific and general academic advice
   - Priority-based ordering (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
   - Quick action buttons where applicable (e.g., "Add Study Session", "Review Notes", "Practice Problems")
   - Specific, actionable steps the student can take immediately
   - FOR UPCOMING ASSESSMENTS: Focus on preparation strategies (study plans, review materials, practice)
   - FOR COMPLETED ASSESSMENTS: Focus on improvement strategies based on actual performance
   - FOR EMPTY CATEGORIES: Provide specific guidance on adding assessments (types, quantities, target scores)
   - Clearly distinguish between "prepare for upcoming exam" vs "improve assignment quality" vs "add assessments to empty category"


IMPORTANT: 
- Current GPA: ${currentGPA} (0.0-4.0 scale)
- Current Course Grade: ${currentGrade}% (0-100% scale)
- Target: ${targetValue} (${goalType === 'COURSE_GRADE' ? 'percentage grade 0-100%' : 'GPA scale 0.0-4.0'})
- Provide analysis based on realistic improvement potential
- If target is percentage (0-100%), compare with current course percentage (${currentGrade}%), not GPA
- Always base analysis on WEIGHTED PERCENTAGES of assessments (not just unweighted averages).
- When goalType is GPA, always map the final percentage to GPA using the provided rule (e.g., "97% and above = 4.0").
- Provide clear analysis of achievability with specific reasoning
